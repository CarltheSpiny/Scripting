        <h1>How to use this script</h1>
        <span>Program written by Miguel</span>
        <p>This script will automatically reserve rooms at the CPP Library website
            with some help from you, the user.
        </p>
        <p>1. You will be prompted to enter your credentials for myCPP in the terminal*. You will need to confim the push on your phone for the program to continue.</p>
        <p>2. You will confirm the date you want to reserve. The program will assume 8 days from the current date. You can manually set a date if desired.</p>
        <p>3. Then you will select the times you want this room for. Please note the times need to be sequential and can not exceed 3 hours.</p>
        <p>4. Then you need to select the room you want. Please note that HU (Hermanos Unidos) uses the 5439 room.</p>
        <p>5. You will then confirm when you want the program to execute, defaulting to today at 11:59 PM, but you can manually set the time</p>
        <p> Please note the program may hiccup from time to time and internet connection may cause timeout errors. Feel free to report any errors to the dev.</p>
        <span>*The "terminal" is the black or blue window. When in doubt, check this window.</span>
